## 📋 Project Description

This project implements a complete ML pipeline for environmental sound classification using the UrbanSound8K dataset. The system can:

- Classify 10 types of environmental sounds
- Process audio files in real-time through a web interface
- Retrain the model with new audio data
- Monitor model performance and system health
